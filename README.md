ReactiveApp
===========

ReactiveApp is an opinionated MVVM app framework built on top of ReactiveUI to built applications for the Windows platform with support for Xamarin.

##Reactive Extensions

ReactiveApp uses Rx for almost everything as does ReactiveUI. `IObservable` is preferred over `Task`.
