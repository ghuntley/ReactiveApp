ReactiveApp
===========

ReactiveApp is an opinionated mobile app framework built on top of ReactiveUI to built applications for the Windows and Xamarin platforms.

##Reactive Extensions

ReactiveApp uses Rx for almost everything as does ReactiveUI. `IObservable` is preferred over `Task`.

##ReactiveApp vs ReactiveUI

ReactiveApp is not the same as ReactiveUI or a replacement. ReactiveApp is built on top of ReactiveUI and should be seen as a complementary set of API's inspired by MvvmCross.

##How do I use it

At this moment ReactiveApp is still in development, so things might be broken. NuGet packages are available from https://www.nuget.org/packages/reactiveapp/.
